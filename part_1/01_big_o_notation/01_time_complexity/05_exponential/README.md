# Exponential Growth O($2^n$)

![Logarithmic vs Exponential curve](<Logarithmic vs Exponential curve.png>)

Exponential growth is the opposite of logarithmic growth because logarithmic curve slows down as the input size increases while the exponential curve grows faster. So, an algorithm that run in exponential time is not scalable at all.
